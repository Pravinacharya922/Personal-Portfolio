            <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p className= "about">Hello! I’m Pravin Acharya, a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the University 
            of Illinois Chicago. My journey in tech began with a fascination for problem-solving, and
             I’ve since developed skills in various programming languages, including Java, C++, Python,
              SQL, JavaScript, and React. I have always been eager to learn new technologies and push the 
              boundaries of my knowledge.
            Currently, I am seeking a Software Engineer internship, where I can apply my technical skills 
            in a real-world environment and contribute to innovative projects. I’ve also participated in 
            hackathons, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with others to create impactful solutions in a short time frame.
            Outside of coding, I am deeply passionate about learning, exploring new ideas, and staying up to date 
            with the latest trends in technology. I believe in the power of teamwork and constantly strive to improve my problem-solving abilities.
             Feel free to connect with me, and let's create something amazing together!</p>
